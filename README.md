## General Info
Metabolomics is a field of research which is new and fast growing. It looks at biological compounds extracted from minimally invasive tissue and fluid samples such as blood plasma, urine and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). These compounds can be used to determine a person’s health status as well as what they are at risk of.

The field is very data heavy and its newness makes it the perfect environment for innovation. It’s an ideal space for data science projects with a focus on social and/or public good.

This project takes an existing dataset produced by the Mayo Clinic in 2013 and uses various statistical and machine learning methods to extract metabolites significant to Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

The significant metabolites were then compared against metabolites found significant by other literature to determine the reliability of metabolomics testing for this disease.
